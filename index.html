        <h2>Robot Web Architecture</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            A variety of routes are available for architecting a robot web
            application. A common route is building web technologies on an
            existing robot framework. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is one of
            the more popular robot middlewares to build upon.
          </p>
          <p>
            ROS is one of the top frameworks to program robots and can run on a
            variety of robots, from a <a href="http://turtlebot.com/">TurtleBot</a>
            to a <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview">PR2</a> to
            an Arduino connected to a computer. ROS - and other robot middleware
            frameworks - provide common robot functionality, including drivers for
            interfacing with a variety of sensors and actuators and algorithms for
            navigation, perception, and manipulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            While ROS works great for applications on the robot, another layer
            is needed to connect external devices and applications, like an
            Arduino or web app. Rosbridge is both a JSON spec for interacting
            with ROS and a transport layer, providing a WebSocket for clients to
            communicate over.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the browser layer sits ros.js, a JavaScript library that
            communicates with ROS on the robot over rosbridge's WebSocket
            server. It's a lightweight, evented library that provides a
            convenient abstraction to core ROS functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ros.js is meant to be a lightweight, core component of the
            client-side robot web application. However, the real benefits of the
            Robot Web Tools organization is JavaScript modules and tools that
            build off these foundations. Check out the <a href="#tools">Tools

              is the core library for exposing ROS-level functionality. It provides
              publishing and subscribing to topics, calling services, and listing
              params.

              - Rosbridge is the gateway between ROS and the web. Ros.js
              communicates with rosbridge, which translates the JSON to ROS

              The RMS is a tool designed to control ROS enabled robots from the web. 
              RMS is written ina robot-platform independent manner allowing for the 
              control of a variety of robots. In addition to being cross-platform, 
              RMS allows for basic user management, interface management, and content 
              management.
